## 💼 Featured Projects

### Andala.ai: MLOps Platform for Multimodal AI
End-to-end MLOps infrastructure for deploying multimodal models (music, video, image generation). Built scalable inference APIs with PyTorch and Django, implemented CI/CD pipelines for automated model deployment, and reduced inference costs by 45% through GPU optimization and caching strategies.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Django, PyTorch, AWS, Docker, CI/CD

### LLM-Assisted Learning Platform
AI-powered e-learning platform with LangChain-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Integrated domain-specific LLMs, vector databases, and personalized tutoring agents enabling real-time adaptive learning with sub-second retrieval latency for hundreds of concurrent users.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, FastAPI, LangChain, RAG, Redis, Vector DBs, Docker

### SpinShot: Real-Time Multiplayer Gaming Platform ([SpinShot](https://github.com/osallak/SpinShot))
Real-time multiplayer pong game with WebSocket communication and microservices architecture. Supports hundreds of simultaneous players with minimal latency, featuring chat, matchmaking, authentication, and comprehensive end-to-end testing.
- **Tech Stack:** NestJS, TypeScript, WebSocket, PostgreSQL, Docker

### Streamix: Video Streaming Platform ([Streamix](https://github.com/osallak/streamix))
Netflix-style streaming platform with dynamic content loading, server-side rendering, and optimized caching. Implemented analytics and user behavior tracking for personalized recommendations, reducing page load time by 40%.
- **Tech Stack:** Next.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, TailwindCSS

### IRC Server: Network Programming in C++ ([IRC](https://github.com/osallak/ft_irc))
RFC 1459-compliant IRC server with efficient concurrency and event handling. Implemented message routing, user authentication, and command parsing demonstrating mastery of sockets, multi-threading, and low-level networking.
- **Tech Stack:** C++, Network Programming, Unix, Concurrency

## 🎓 Background
- **1337 School (42 Network)** - Completed Common Core at 100%, currently pursuing Senior Software Architect specialization with focus on AI/MLOps and distributed systems
- **Advanced Certifications** - Python, JavaScript, C/C++ (CodinGame)
